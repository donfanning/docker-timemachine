# docker-timemachine
A docker container to compile the lastest version of Netatalk in order to run a Time Machine server.

## Installation

To download the docker container and execute it, simply run:

```
$ docker run -h timemachine --name timemachine --restart=unless-stopped -d -v /route/to/your/timemachine:/timemachine -it -p 548:548 -p 636:636 odarriba/timemachine
```

To add users, just run this command:

```
$ docker exec timemachine add-account USERNAME PASSWORD MOUNT_POINT [VOL_SIZE_MB]
```

To add a user to a share or create a new share:

```
$ docker exec timemachine add-share USERNAME MOUNT_POINT [VOL_SIZE_MB]
```

But take care that:
* `MOUNT_POINT` should be an absolute path, preferably inside `/timemachine`, so it will be stored in your external volume.
* `VOL_SIZE_MB` is an optional parameter. It indicates the max volume size for that user.

Now you have a docker instance running `netatalk`.

### Configure using environment variables

You can configure the container using environment variables (for example, if you use a `docker-compose` environment).

There are these environment variables:

* **AFP_LOGIN**: User name
* **AFP_PASSWORD**: User password
* **AFP_NAME**: Name of the volume
* **AFP_SIZE_LIMIT**: Size in MB of the volume (optional)

Using these variables, the container will create a user at boot time (only one per container).

## Auto-discovering

Avahi daemon is commonly used to help your computers to find the services provided by a server.

Avahi isn't built into this Docker image because, due to Docker's networking limitations, Avahi can't spread it's messages to announce the services.

**If you want to enable this feature, you can install Avahi daemon on your host** following these steps (Ubuntu version):

* Install `avahi-daemon`: run `sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon avahi-utils`
* Copy the file from `avahi/nsswitch.conf` to `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
* Copy the service description file from `avahi/afpd.service` to `/etc/avahi/services/afpd.service`
* Restart Avahi's daemon: `sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart`

**But why install this on your host and not in the container?** Because if you don't do it this way, the discovery message won't be able to reach your computers.

## Auto start the service

As the image has been started using the `--restart=always` flag, it will start when the computers boots up.
